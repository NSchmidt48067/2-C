Which interface did you implement using linked lists, and why?
MyText because I tried an array and found out that it was not possible in anyway to complete that way through hours of rubber ducking that ended in anger.

Which interface did you implement using arrays, and why?
The BoundedStack because I had too.

What part or aspect of this project was the most challenging?
That TestBoundedStack one. I could not get it to 100% after MANY submissions.

What part or aspect of this project was the most tedious or
uninteresting?
The most tedious was trying to get the BoundedStack to work properly. I fixed one thing and another would break. I rewrote that class many times striving for 100%

How did the difficulty and time required for this project
compare to those in your other CS/IT courses?
It was about the same, but I ran out of time to do it during normal hours thanks to my busy schedule. Not making excuses. Just saying that I ran out of time to do it except now. At 130 in the moring.

Any other comments for your instructor?
BoundedStack was terrible because of the 1 failure that I have and how many hours I spent on it.
